Student Database Application
Scenario: You are a Database Administrator for a university and need to create an application to manage student enrollments and balance.
Your application should do the following:
- ask the user how many new students will be added to he database
- the user should be prompted to enter the name and year for each student
- the student should have a 5-digit unique ID, with the first number being their grade level
- a student can enroll in the following courses:
	History 101
	Mathematics 101
	English 101
	Chemistry 101
	Computer Science 101
- each course costs $600
- the student should be able to view their balance and pay the tuition
- to see the status of the student, we should see their name, ID, courses enrolled and balance
